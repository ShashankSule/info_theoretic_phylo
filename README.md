# Information Theoretic Phylogenetics 

This is a working directory for the Summer 2021 information theoretic phylogenetics project in Dr. Cummings' Lab at UMD. We worked on essentially two information-theoretic algorithms for phylogeny reconstruction from aligned sequence data--the information gain-based divisive algorithm and the variation of information-based agglomerative algorithm. We also developed variants of the two by tweaking branch lengths and using neighbour joining for the agglomerative case. 

* Go [here](https://github.com/ShashankSule/info_theoretic_phylo/blob/main/info_gain_model.md) to know more about the divisive algorithm of generating trees from aligned DNA sequences.

* Go [here](https://github.com/ShashankSule/info_theoretic_phylo/blob/main/agg_clustering.md) to know more about the variation-of-information based algorithm of agglomerative clustering of DNA sequences. 

## Performance and Computation 

* Go [here](https://github.com/ShashankSule/info_theoretic_phylo/tree/main/testing) to check out how these algorithms perform on some sample datasets. 

* Go [here](https://github.com/ShashankSule/info_theoretic_phylo/blob/main/Computing_docs.md) to find out more about the computational aspects of using our algorithm on randomly generated sequence alignment data. 

## Example
