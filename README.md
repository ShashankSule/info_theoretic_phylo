# Information Theoretic Phylogenetics 

A working directory for the information theoretic phylogenetics group in Dr. Cummings' Lab at UMD. 

* Go [here](https://github.com/ShashankSule/info_theoretic_phylo/blob/main/info_gain_model.md) to know more about the information gain model of generating trees from aligned DNA sequences.

* Go [here](https://github.com/ShashankSule/info_theoretic_phylo/blob/main/info_gain_model.md) to know more about the variation-of-information based algorithm of agglomerative clustering of DNA sequences. 

* Go [here](https://github.com/ShashankSule/info_theoretic_phylo/blob/main/diagnostics_and_testing.md) to see some tests and diagnostics of these two methods against data simulated in `evolver`.
